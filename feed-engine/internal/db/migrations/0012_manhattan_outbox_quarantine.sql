-- 0012_manhattan_outbox_quarantine.sql
--
-- An escape hatch for the outbox drain, and the only one it has ever had.
--
-- Head-of-line blocking is correct while a row can still land: later rows depend
-- on earlier ones, and running ahead would write edges pointing at nodes that do
-- not exist. It stops being correct the moment a row cannot land at all — then it
-- is not ordering the queue, it is ending it. Before this, a row that failed
-- twelve times logged INCIDENT and then kept the head of the queue forever: one
-- unfixable registration stopped this brain's entire naming-plane output
-- indefinitely, with a log line as the only signal and a hand-written migration
-- as the only cure. 0007 exists because there was no operator path.
--
-- A quarantined row is neither dropped nor delivered. It keeps its payload, its
-- error and its id; the drain simply stops claiming it, so everything queued
-- behind it moves again. It represents a naming-plane write that did NOT happen,
-- so it is reported as an incident on every drain tick until a person clears
-- blocked_at — loud by construction rather than by anyone remembering to look.
--
--   what is stuck:  SELECT id, op, blocked_at, blocked_reason, payload
--                     FROM manhattan_outbox
--                    WHERE blocked_at IS NOT NULL AND delivered_at IS NULL
--                    ORDER BY id;
--
--   put one back:   UPDATE manhattan_outbox
--                      SET blocked_at = NULL, blocked_reason = NULL,
--                          attempts = 0, next_attempt_at = NOW()
--                    WHERE id = $1;
--
-- Returning a row to the queue re-enters it at its original id, so the ordering
-- the drain depends on survives the round trip.

-- The drain's query is now "undelivered, not quarantined, due, oldest first", so
-- it gets its own partial index. idx_manhattan_outbox_pending from 0005 stays:
-- the backlog counters still ask for everything undelivered, quarantined rows
-- included, because a write that did not happen must not disappear from the
-- depth a health check reports.
